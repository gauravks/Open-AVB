[fqtss]

# FQTSS mode - how talker traffic will be shaped.
#
# Modes are:
# 0 = AVB_SHAPER_DISABLED  - Disable FQTSS (no shaping)
# 1 = AVB_SHAPER_DROP_ALL  - Drop all frames
# 2 = AVB_SHAPER_ALL_NONSR - Treat everything as non-SR traffic
# 3 = AVB_SHAPER_DROP_SR   - Drop all AVTP frames
# 4 = AVB_SHAPER_SW        - Credit-based shaping per-class (in software)
# 5 = AVB_SHAPER_HWQ_PER_CLASS - shaping in HW per AVB class
#
# By default on platforms which support HW shaping, the default mode
# will be AVB_SHAPER_HWQ_PER_CLASS, on other platforms the default
# mode is AVB_SHAPER_SW.

[maap]

# The endpoint can use the MAAP daemon to allocate a multicast address for
# each stream, using the dest_addr value from the Talker configuration file
# only as a backup in case the MAAP daemon is not available.
# Set port to the localhost port used by the MAAP daemon if MAAP support is
# desired.
# If port is 0 (the default value), then the MAAP daemon is not used and the
# endpoint always uses the dest_addr value.
# Note that if the MAAP daemon is not available, and a dest_addr value is not
# specified, then an address from beginning of the MAAP locally administered
# Pool will be used.  Due to the high likelihood of address conflicts,
# relying on this backup method is not recommended.
port=15364

[shaper]

# The endpoint can use the Shaper daemon to smooth the transmission of packets.
# This is useful for situations where the batch_factor value in the Talker INI
# file is set to a value greater than 1, and multiple frames are being
# generated during the same callback.  The batch_factor and Shaper daemon are
# useful for situations where the CPU load needs to be reduced or callback
# timing for the frame generation functions is unreliable.
# Set port to the localhost port used by the Shaper daemon if Shaper support is
# desired.
# If port is 0 (the default value), then the Shaper daemon is not used and the
# endpoint frames are transmitted at the time they are generated.
#port=15365

[srp]

# To disable dynamic SRP operation in the case of manually preconfigured streams
# (e.g. in an AVB network using Broadcom Polar Switches) set:
#preconfigured = 1
# CAUTION: All streams registered by talker or listener are assumed to be valid.
# WARNING: Preconfigured streams require COMPLETE manual stream configuration
#          on EVERY device in the network, without exception.
#          ANY NETWORK WHICH IS NOT EITHER
#           - USING DYNAMIC SRP ON **EVERY** NETWORK DEVICE, OR
#           - HAS COMPLETE MANUAL STREAM CONFIGURATION ON **EVERY** NETWORK DEVICE
#          IS NOT AN ETHERNET AVB NETWORK AND WILL NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY.

# IEEE 802.1ba section 6.4 requires that SRP grant stream reservations on a link
# only if that link is "asCapable" with gPTP (IEEE 802.1AS) operating.  To bypass
# that requirement, set:
# gptp_asCapable_not_required = 1
# WARNING: This non-standards complaint option is intended ONLY to allow for the
#          use of PTPv2 on older AVB netowrks where gPTP may not be supported.
#          ANY NETWORK WHICH IS NOT USING PTP TO KEEP ALL DEVICE CLOCKS IN SYNC
#          IS NOT AN ETHERNET AVB NETWORK AND WILL NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY.
